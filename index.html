                 <h2>OMAEGA</h2>
                 <h3>Omni-Directional Multi-Spectral AI-Enabled Ground Vehicle Awarness System</h3>
                 <div>

<p>OMAEGA is a super system consisting of fixed-mount, wide-FOV multi-spectral low-light sensitive visible, long- and short-wave sensors; modular low-size, weight, and power (SWaP) distributed GPU and central-based processing elements; and display hardware and software components aligned with Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and designed to be deployed on PEO GCS vehicles with B-Kit installation.</p> 

<p>The OMAEGA architecture is designed with the maximum amount of user flexibility in mind and scales to allow new sensor or processing technology to be added without significant hardware changes or costly, time-consuming internal modification. This is possible by using a models-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach to system design and strict open-architecture design practices. DRI leverages existing tools and analytics to facilitate simulation of changing factors in multiple engineering domains.</p> 

<p>Additionally, OMAEGA is designed with open-standard interfaces such as FACE, sensor open system architecture (SOSA), HOST, CMOSS, VICTORY, and MOSA to support a modular, interoperable, and upgradeable design. OMAEGA is also fully Ground Combat Systems (GCS) Common Infrastructure Architecture (GCIA)-compliant, utilizing a central network switch to manage data across all subsystems and connected platforms.</p>

                 <h2>ALPHA-NET</h2>
                 <h3>Aggressive Learning and Predictive AI with an Advanced Heterogeneous Sensor Network</h3>
                 <div>

<p>ALPHA-NET is a embedded system consiting of an optical sensor, collocated with various appendages of a vehicle, attached to an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX GPU with a wiring harness. An upgrade to Orin NX is in progress and estimated complete by end of 2024.</p>

<p>The design is intended to support computing at edge. The ALPHA employs the sensor with the Nvidia computing hardware and software to identify, track and provide the relative position & velocity of an object approaching with respect to the vehicle.</p>
